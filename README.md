## My views about the tasks
In my view, the tasks provided were very good and quite well balanced for someone to develop their coading skills. The tasks were fun and a lot to learn from.
I had a blast making them, and it was a very nice experince. Sometimes, these tasks made me mad, other times they gave me a joy of success. I really loved them.
## My Introduction
Hello There, I am Himanshu Lath, A northie guy hailing from Bhagalpur, Bihar. Starting with how I got to know about amFOSS, I got to know about it by quora. 
Only after that did I got to know about Amrita University. I learned about the club and it's antiques and got quit interested in it.
Honestly, when I joinied in, I was not sure which club to join. But after trying out a few of tasks, I was sure, this is the club for me.
I personally knew, C++ as the only language in coading. It was in our 11-12th syllabus. A love for coading started growing from there for me.
Thank You for taking out your important time, to know a bit about me.
