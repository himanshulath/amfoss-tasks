I couldn't make this one, however much I tried. I thought up of the logic, I was able to implement it as well, I corrected my code for some edge cases as well, but still I was unable to get accepted in this one. I am getting 3/11 test cases wrong.. Specifically, Test Case- 3, 4 and 5. I thought to do try it in python as well, but thought against it, because of the type of logic I implemented.
