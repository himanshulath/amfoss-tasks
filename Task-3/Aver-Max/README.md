This one is wierd. I tried to make it in C++ first, I thaught of the code, implemented it, the code runs fine for my tests and the test case, but failed other test cases. I thaught my logic is problemetic, So I left it. Then a few days later, I tried it once again.. Same results. Then I thaught lets, try it in C.. Even worse results... After that.. I don't know why.. I decided to try it in Python.. Somehow.. Using the same logic.. All the test cases passed.. Here..
