This was the toughest Task Yet.. I mean it was meant to be tough anyways.. So Yeah.. It was ton of fun as well.. And frustating as well. I did 7/10 of them. They are either in C (2-codes), C++ (4-codes) or in Python (1-code). I did try one more.. but was unable to make it so I left it, 3/11 test cases fails there.. Including the sample test case.
