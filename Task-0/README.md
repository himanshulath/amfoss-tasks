This task was fun, to say the least.
At first, I was unable to do it because my computer had an encrypted SSD.
So, I searched the web and found a way using Control Panel. 
The thing was, it didn't work out that well.
On my PC, the option to disable encryption was simply not there.
So I called my friend, who also had a new PC, and asked him.
He also experienced the same issue.
Then, I had a talk with some seniors, and they encouraged me to search even furhter.
So, I did that, and eventually found out how to.
It was fun, and I got to know a lot more than I thaught, I would.
