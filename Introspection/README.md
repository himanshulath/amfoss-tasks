# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
I really like coding. I have always had a knack for computer, and always thaught that this is the way for me.
That's why in 11th when a choice for CS was thrown at me, even if it was the most difficult, as I was told at that time, I took it.
And sure enough, It didn't dissapoint. I love coding, and from that day onwards, my love has grown and grown, never once stopping.
So choosing me, I will help and grow myself and everyone else around me.
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
While doing the flutter task, I was fasinated by the fact that I could make my own app, just like that. 
I loved it and I always wanted to be an Android Developer, so that's my first goal.
I also know JS and would like to learn it's frameworks like React to make professional websites.
So for the next 6 months, I will focus on these two, and if I could, I will try my hand at golang as well, but that is a low priority right now.
## How would you contribute back to the club?
I can help in anything, from origanising events to everyone's growth. I like to interact and learn so I can learn from others and in turn, give them something as well.
## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I think, the process is very nice, almost perfect, if I may say. Ofcourse nothing is perfect, but at least I can't even point out what that inperfection here is.
I loved the process and I loved how I got to know so much in this Journey of 1 Month.
