This task, I tried a lot to solve it. I researhed how to use go and how to make modules out of it, I got stuck so many times in between but still tried my best and eventually found some solution. At last I was able to make a Scraper only to find that the framework I was using i.e. Colly was actually a Static framework and Forbs was a dynamic rendered website. Now I started to find how to use Geziyor a Dynamic scraping framework, but couldn't complete it. I was unable to complete it not due to my inability but due to my PC's wierd quirks. It was running fine after a lot of tweaking with go, then suddenly, It stopped. It started to show error in the first line of the code itself, i.e. package main and however much I searched it always gave some mudane answer. I even tried it on Windows and the results were the same. So I have just uploaded all the files in their Incomplete stage.
